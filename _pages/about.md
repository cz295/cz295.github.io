Hi, my name is Zekang Cheng (程泽康) and I came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linquan_County">Linquan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui">Anhui</a> (安徽临泉). Currently I am a quantitative analyst in Citigroup, based in London. I work with the trade data of FX STIRT (Short Term Interest Rate Trading) and linear FX trading. I have also worked in FX options trading and quant team, as well as the Equities central risk team.
<br/><br/>
I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/">Engineering Department</a> at University of Cambridge, advised by <a href="https://ieef.cam.ac.uk/wps-members/dr-jie-li/">Dr. Jie Li</a>. During my Ph.D. I worked on a finite element method to solve multiphase problems numerically using an <a href="https://cz295.github.io/projects/mesh">adaptive moving mesh</a>. This method was used to investigate some interesting interfacial flow problems, including <a href="https://cz295.github.io/projects/dripping/">droplet formation</a>, <a href="https://cz295.github.io/projects/bouncing/">droplet collision</a>, <a href="https://cz295.github.io/projects/bridge/">liquid bridge breakup</a> etc. Before Cambridge, I studied in <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a> and graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in theoretical and applied mechanics. 
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I enjoy swimming, cycling, running, reading and walking. I am an amateur triathlete and occasionally participate in triathlon races.

Hi, my name is Zekang Cheng (程泽康). Currently I am a quantitative analyst in Citigroup, based in London. I work with the trade data of FX STIRT (Short Term Interest Rate Trading) and voice FX trading. I have also worked in FX options trading and quant team, as well as the Equities central risk team.

I obtained my Ph.D. degress at the <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/">Engineering Department</a> at University of Cambridge, advised by <a href="https://www.ieef.cam.ac.uk/user/jl305">Dr. Jie Li</a>.

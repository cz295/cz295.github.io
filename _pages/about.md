Hi, my name is Zekang Cheng (程泽康). Currently I am a quantitative analyst in Citigroup, based in London. I work with the trade data of FX STIRT (Short Term Interest Rate Trading) and voice FX trading. I have also worked in FX options trading and quant team, as well as the Equities central risk team.

I obtained my Ph.D. degress at the [Engineering Department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge, advised by [Dr. Jie Li](https://www.ieef.cam.ac.uk/user/jl305). 

I came from [Linquan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linquan_County), [Anhui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui) (安徽临泉). 

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

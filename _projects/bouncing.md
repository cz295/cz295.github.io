<div style='text-align: justify;'>
Droplet collision occurs frequently in many natural and industrial processes, for example, the formation of raindrops, spray and atomisation. This problem 
can be characterised by a dimensionless number, the <i>Weber</i> number. Experimental studies on the head-on collision of droplets of equal size have 
identified four distinct outcomes with increasing values of <i> We </i> number: 1) coalescence after minor deformation; 2) bouncing; 3) coalescence after large
deformation; and 4) coalescence followed by separation with the generation of secondary droplets. We are interested in the determining force from regime 1) and regime 2).

The gas film between the two droplets play an important role

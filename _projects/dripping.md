The formation of droplets from a faucet is widely observed in everyday life. At the end of a tap, a pendant drop forms and grows very slowly until 
its size exceeds a certain limit. The droplet elongates, forms a neck in the middle and eventually detachs from the faucet. The final breakup process 
is a critical phenomenon connected to a singularity of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation with interface. It is a challenging issue to address for 
a numerical or analytical method.

A numerical treatment for interface topology change has been implemented to solve issues like this and we successfully simulated an experiment of water 
droplet formation from a faucet.

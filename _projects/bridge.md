This video shows the experimental study of a liquid bridge breakup driven by thermocapillarity. This was conducted by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4073">Ueno et al.
(2012) </a> in the International Space Station.

In general, interfacial tension decreases as the temperature increases. As a result, non-uniform temperature can result in fluid motion along the interface, and eventually flow in the bulk fluid. This is called <b>thermocapillarity</b>.
